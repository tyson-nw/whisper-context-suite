# whisper-context-suite

This project uses [https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win](Faster whisper Standalone), [https://github.com/simonw/llm](simonw/llm) and [https://github.com/simonw/llm-gpt4all](simonw/llm-gpt4aqll) to allow you to transcribe, translate, and summarize audio content. Using registry keys and the `summarize.ps1` powershell script you can add commands to the context menu in windows to analize files.
